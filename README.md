# php-fileviewer
It's a simple fileviewer in php. It can list directorys, show files and that's it 4 the moment.


# Config
You can set a password with the `$lock` variable. You can comment out the `$lock`-variable to disable the password protection.
If you rename the file don't forget to change the `$thisfile` variable.
The variable `$dir` is the path of the root-directory the filemanager should show.
